Let's take a look at data on our solar system. It is organized into a **data matrix**, where:

- each row is called a ________________________.

- each column is called a ________________________.

```{r}
kable(planets)
```

It is always good to look for a description of your data to better understand how the data was collected and on whom/what.

```{r}
data.frame(
  variable = colnames(planets),
  description = c(
    "Name of planet",
    "Mass in 10^24 kg",
    "Length of day in hours",
    "Whether mean temperature in Celsius is positive or not",
    "Number of moons",
    "Whether the planet has a set of rings around it",
    "Surface pressure in bars"
  )
) |> 
  kable()
```

Describe some patterns or features you notice about this data.

\newpage

What do you think the `NA` in the `surface_pressure` column means?

# Variable types

![](img/diagram.png){width=5in fig-align="left"}

A ______________________ variable (sometimes called quantitative) has numeric meaning and we can do mathematical operations with it.

- A ______________________ variable is a type of  ______________________ variable with a finite or countable number of possibilities.

- A ______________________ variable is a type of  ______________________ variable with an infinite number of possibilities.

A ______________________ variable (sometimes called qualitative) does not have numeric meaning, even if it is recorded as a number, and we cannot do mathematical operations with it.

- A ______________________ variable is a type of  ______________________ variable with a natural ordering to its possible values.

- A ______________________ variable is a type of  ______________________ variable without a natural ordering to its possible values.

For each variable in the `planets` dataset determine its type.

### OpenIntro Statistics Exercise 1.12: UN Votes

The visualization below shows voting patterns in the United States, Canada, and Mexico in the United Nations General Assembly on a variety of issues. Specifically, for a given year between 1946 and 2015, it displays the percentage of roll calls in which the country voted yes for each issue. 

![](img/un-votes.png){width=100%}

Try to draft the data matrix used to produce this visualization, specifically write out the column names and fill in at least four rows.

\vspace*{6cm}

Indicate each variable type.

# Relationships between variables

If two variables 

- have a correspondence, we say they are **associated**. 
- do not have a correspondence, we say they are **not associated**.

Can you think of an unrecorded variable that is likely associated with the mass of a planet or having a ring system?

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes the American Time Use Survey which has been subset to include only respondents who are enrolled in college or university. 

```{r}
#| fig-height: 2.75
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-align: center
atus_plot1 <- 
  ggplot(atus_college, aes(x = sleep_time, y = weekly_earnings)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Time spent sleeping", y = "Weekly Earnings") +
  theme_bw()

atus_plot2 <- 
  ggplot(atus_college, aes(x = age, y = weekly_earnings)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Weekly Earnings") +
  theme_bw()

gridExtra::grid.arrange(atus_plot2, atus_plot1, nrow = 1)
```

Does there appear to be an association between weekly earnings and age? If so, would you say it is a **positive association**, meaning that an increase in one variable is associated with an increase in the other, or a **negative association**, meaning increase in one is associated with a decrease in the other?

\vspace*{1.5cm}

Does there appear to be an association between weekly earnings and time spent sleeping? If so, is it positive or negative?

\newpage

If we want to investigate if a change in a variable causes another we call the first variable an **explanatory variable** and the second one the **response variable**.

\begin{center}
explanatory variable $\rightarrow$ response variable
\end{center}

Which would you label response and explanatory between weekly earnings and age?

# Study types: Experiment versus observational study

In an _________________________ the researchers do not cause any intervention, they collect data in a way that does not directly interfere with how the data arise.

In an _________________________ the researchers cause an intervention and then collect data to investigate possible causal relationships. 

### OpenIntro Statistics Exercise 1.4: Buteyko method 

The Buteyko method is a shallow breathing technique developed by Konstantin Buteyko, a Russian doctor, in 1952. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the Buteyko method can reduce asthma symptoms and improve quality of life. In a scientific study to determine the effectiveness of this method, researchers recruited 600 asthma patients aged 18-69 who relied on medication for asthma treatment. These patients were randomly split into two research groups: one practiced the Buteyko method and the other did not. Patients were scored on quality of life, activity, asthma symptoms, and medication reduction on a scale from 0 to 10. On average, the participants in the Buteyko group experienced a significant reduction in asthma symptoms and an improvement in quality of life.

Identify the main research question of the study.

### OpenIntro Statistics Exercise 1.3 Air pollution and birth outcomes

Researchers collected data to examine the relationship between air pollutants and preterm births in Southern California. During the study air pollution levels were measured by air quality monitoring stations. Specifically, levels of carbon monoxide were recorded in parts per million, nitrogen dioxide and ozone in parts per hundred million, and coarse particulate matter (PM10) in μg/m3. Length of gestation data were collected on 143,196 births between the years 1989 and 1993, and air pollution exposure during gestation was calculated for each birth. The analysis suggested that increased ambient PM10 and, to a lesser degree, CO concentrations may be associated with the occurrence of preterm births.
