Let's take a look at data on our solar system. It is organized into a **data matrix**, where:

- each row is called a ________________________.

- each column is called a ________________________.

```{r}
kable(planets)
```

It is always good to look for a description of your data to better understand how the data was collected and on whom/what.

```{r}
data.frame(
  variable = colnames(planets),
  description = c(
    "Name of planet",
    "Mass in 10^24 kg",
    "Length of day in hours",
    "Whether mean temperature in Celsius is positive or not",
    "Number of moons",
    "Whether the planet has a set of rings around it",
    "Surface pressure in bars"
  )
) |> 
  kable()
```

Describe some patterns or features you notice about this data.

# Variable types

![](img/diagram.png){width=5in fig-align="left"}

A ______________________ variable (sometimes called quantitative) has numeric meaning and we can do mathematical operations with it.

- A ______________________ variable is a type of  ______________________ variable with a finite or countable number of possibilities.

- A ______________________ variable is a type of  ______________________ variable with an infinite number of possibilities.

A ______________________ variable (sometimes called qualitative) does not have numeric meaning, even if it is recorded as a number, and we cannot do mathematical operations with it.

- A ______________________ variable is a type of  ______________________ variable with a natural ordering to its possible values.

- A ______________________ variable is a type of  ______________________ variable withouts a natural ordering to its possible values.

For each variable in the `planets` dataset determine its type.

### OpenIntro Exercise 1.12 UN Votes. 

The visualization below shows voting patterns in the United States, Canada, and Mexico in the United Nations General Assembly on a variety of issues. Specifically, for a given year between 1946 and 2015, it displays the percentage of roll calls in which the country voted yes for each issue. 

![](img/un-votes.png){width=100%}

(a) Try to draft the data matrix used to produce this visualization, specifically write out the column names and fill in at least four rows.

(b) Indicate each variable type.

# Relationships between variables

If two variables 

- have a correspondence we say they are **associated**. 
- do not have a correspondence we say they are **not associated**.

Can you think of an unrecorded variable that is likely associated with the mass of a planet or having a ring system?
